## Introduction to Elastic Beanstalk

![Elastic Beanstalk Icon](./images/elastic-beanstalk-icon.png)

It is a PaaS which allows to quickly deploy and manager web-apps on AWS **without worrying about the underlying infrastructure**.

### What is Platform as a Service? (PaaS)

A platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

PaaS is like a renting a pre-built cloud workspace for developing and running applications. Saves time, money, and allows for easy scaling.

---

- Not recommended for _"Production"_ applications. Talking about enterprise, large companies.
- Powered by a CloudFormation template setup for you:
  - Elastic Load Balancer
  - Autoscaling Groups
  - RDS Database
  - EC2 Instance pre-configured (or custom) platforms
  - Monitoring (CloudWatch, SNS)
  - In-Place and Blue/Green deployment methodologies
  - Security (Rotates Passwords)
  - Can run **Dockerize** environments

### Supported Languages

- Ruby
- Python
- PHP
- Tomcat
- NodeJS

### Web vs Worker Environment

#### Web Environment

- Has two variants
  - **Load Balanced Environment**
    - Uses ASG and set to scale
    - Use an ELB
    - Designed to Scale
    - Variable cost associated based on load
  - **Single-Instance Env**
    - Still uses and AGS but Desired Capacity set to 1 to ensure server always running.
    - No ELB to save on cost.
    - Public IP Address has to be used to route traffic to server.
- Creates an ASG (Auto Scaling Group)
- Creates an ELB (Elastic Load Balance) - optional

#### Worker Environment

- For backend jobs
- Creates and ASG
- Creates and SQS Queue
- Installs the SQSD daemon on the EC2 Instances
- Create CloudWatch Alarm to dynamically scale instances based on health.

### Deployment Policies

These are the deployment policies available with the Elastic Beanstalk

| Deployment Policy             | Load Balanced Env | Single Instance Env |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| All at Once                   | 👍                | 👍                  |
| Rolling                       | 👍                | ❌                  |
| Rolling with additional batch | 👍                | ❌                  |
| Immutable                     | 👍                | 👍                  |

#### All at Once

![All at Once Deployment](./img/elastic-beanstalk-all-at-once-deplyment.png)

- Deploy the new app version to all instances at the same time.
- Takes all instances **out of service** while the deployment process.
- Servers become available again

> The **fastest** but also the most **dangerous** deployment method.
> *In case of Failur*e, you need to roll back the changes by re-deploying the original version again to all instances.

#### Rolling

![Rolling Deployment](./img/elastic-beanstalk-rolling-deplyment.png)

- Deploys the new app version to a batch of instances at a time.
- Takes batch's instances **out of service** while the deployment processes.
- Reattaches updated instances.
- Goes onto next batch, taking them out of service.
- Reattaches those instances (rinse and repeat)

> _In Case of Failure_, You need to perform an additional rolling update in order to roll back the changes.

#### Rolling with Additional Batch

Rolling with additional batch's ensure our capacity is never reduced. This is important for applications were a reduction in capacity could cause availability issues for users.

- Launch new instance that will be used to replace a batch.
- Deploy update app version to new batch.
- Attach the new batch and terminate the existing batch.

> _In case of failure_, you need to perform an additional rolling update to roll back the changes.

#### Immutable

![Immutable](./img/elastic-beanstalk-immutable-deplyment.png)

- Create a new ASG with EC2 instances.
- Deploy the updated version of the app on the new EC2 instances.
- Point the ELB to the new ASG and delete the old ASG which will terminate the old EC2 instances.

> The **safest way** to deploy for critical applications. _In case of failure_ just terminate the new instances since the existing instances still remain.
