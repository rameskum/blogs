## Introduction to Elastic Beanstalk

![Elastic Beanstalk Icon](./images/elastic-beanstalk-icon.png)

It is a PaaS that allows you to quickly deploy and manage web apps on AWS **without worrying about the underlying infrastructure**.

### What is Platform as a Service? (PaaS)

A platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

PaaS is like renting a pre-built cloud workspace for developing and running applications. It saves time and money and allows for easy scaling.

---

It is not recommended for _"Production"_ applications. Talking about enterprise, large companies.

Powered by a CloudFormation template setup for you:

- Elastic Load Balancer
- Autoscaling Groups
- RDS Database
- EC2 Instance pre-configured (or custom) platforms
- Monitoring (CloudWatch, SNS)
- In-place and Blue/Green deployment methodologies
- Security (Rotates Passwords)
- Can run **Dockerize** environments

### Supported Languages

- Ruby
- Python
- PHP
- Tomcat
- NodeJS

### Web vs. Worker Environment

#### Web Environment

- Has two variants
  - **Load Balanced Environment**
    - Uses ASG and set to scale
    - Use an ELB
    - Designed to Scale
    - Variable cost associated based on load
  - **Single-Instance Env**
    - Still uses an AGS, but Desired Capacity is set to 1 to ensure the server is always running.
    - No ELB to save on cost.
    - The Public IP Address has to be used to route traffic to the server.
- Creates an ASG (Auto Scaling Group)
- Creates an ELB (Elastic Load Balance) - optional

#### Worker Environment

- For backend jobs
- Creates and ASG
- Creates and SQS Queue
- Installs the SQSD daemon on the EC2 Instances
- Create CloudWatch Alarm to dynamically scale instances based on health.

### Deployment Policies

These are the deployment policies available with the Elastic Beanstalk

| Deployment Policy             | Load Balanced Env | Single Instance Env |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| All at Once                   | 👍                | 👍                  |
| Rolling                       | 👍                | ❌                  |
| Rolling with additional batch | 👍                | ❌                  |
| Immutable                     | 👍                | 👍                  |

#### All at Once

![All at Once Deployment](./img/elastic-beanstalk-all-at-once-deplyment.png)

- Deploy the new app version to all instances at the same time.
- Takes all instances **out of service** during the deployment process.
- Servers become available again

> The **fastest** but also the most **dangerous** deployment method.
> *In case of Failur*e, you need to roll back the changes by re-deploying the original version again to all instances.

#### Rolling

![Rolling Deployment](./img/elastic-beanstalk-rolling-deplyment.png)

- Deploys the new app version to a batch of instances at a time.
- Takes batch instances **out of service** while the deployment processes.
- Reattaches updated instances.
- Goes onto the next batch, taking them out of service.
- Reattaches those instances (rinse and repeat)

> _In Case of Failure_, You need to perform an additional rolling update in order to roll back the changes.

#### Rolling with Additional Batch

Rolling with additional batch ensure our capacity is never reduced. This is important for applications where a reduction in capacity could cause availability issues for users.

- Launch a new instance that will be used to replace a batch.
- Deploy update app version to new batch.
- Attach the new batch and terminate the existing batch.

> _In case of failure_, you need to perform an additional rolling update to roll back the changes.

#### Immutable

![Immutable](./img/elastic-beanstalk-immutable-deplyment.png)

- Create a new ASG with EC2 instances.
- Deploy the updated version of the app on the new EC2 instances.
- Point the ELB to the new ASG and delete the old ASG, which will terminate the old EC2 instances.

> The **safest way** to deploy for critical applications. _In case of failure_ just terminate the new instances since the existing instances still remain.

### EB - Deployment Methods

| Method                            | Impact of failed deployment                                                                        | Deploy time | No downtime | No DNS change | Rollback progress | code deployed to Instances |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| **All at once**                   | Downtime                                                                                           | ⏰          | ❌          | 👍            | Manual            | Existing                   |
| **Rolling**                       | Single batch out of service; any successful batches before failure running new application version | ⏰⏰ \*     | 👍          | 👍            | Manual            | Existing                   |
| **Rolling with additional batch** | Minimal if first batch fails; otherwise, similar to Rolling                                        | ⏰⏰⏰ \*   | 👍          | 👍            | Manual            | New and Existing           |

| **Blue/Green**                    | Minimal                                                                                            | ⏰⏰⏰⏰    | 👍          | ❌            | Swap URL          | New                        |

\* Time may vary

### EB - In Place vs. Blue/Green Deployment

Elastic Beanstalk, by default, performs in-place updates.

> 👋🏼 In-Place and Blue/Green Deployment are not definitive in definition and the context can change the scope of what they mean.
